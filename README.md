Versatile Web Framework - easily build a website to support different languages and client platforms

The idea will be to call index.pl which will then automatically display
the correct index.htm (or index.tmpl) file based on the browser language
setting (e.g. en-GB), and type (e.g. mobile).

I'm going to supply sample index files in the htdocs directory to give starting
template.

All that's here at the moment is the basic code. The code works as is on my
site, the first thing to do is document and create a suitable template for
any site to easily use.
